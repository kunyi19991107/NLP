        "risk_factors": "Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2025. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. Nasdaq has delisted our securities from trading on Nasdaq, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. On October 29, 2025, we received the determination of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) to deny our request to continue the listing of our shares of common stock on Nasdaq and that the trading in our securities would be suspended at the open of trading on October 31, 2025. We submitted a request for review of the Panel\u2019s decision by the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council. On October 31, 2025, we have since commenced trading of our common stock on the OTC Pink Sheets. As previously disclosed, we have not been in compliance with the requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) to maintain stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million (the \u201cEquity Rule\u201d). In January 2025, a previous Nasdaq panel provided us with an extension until April 22, 2025 to obtain compliance with the Equity Rule. On April 21, 2025, we announced that, following the completion of a financing round including the issuance of shares of Series D Preferred Stock in exchange for marketable securities (the \u201cMarketable Securities\u201d) of another public company convertible under its terms into shares of common stock of such other public company with an aggregate value of $5 million, as well as the application of the proceeds of our February 2025 public offering of shares of common stock and warrants and the proceeds of sales under its equity line of credit, as well as successful negotiations with service providers to reduce outstanding balances payable, we believed that we had regained compliance with the Equity Rule, subject to Nasdaq\u2019s determination, as well as the completion of valuation procedures. In August 2025, in connection with the finalization of our financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as a result of difficulties of completing the valuation of the Marketable Securities in a timely manner, we sold such Marketable Securities at a substantial discount to the face value thereof and recorded the value of such Marketable Securities at the sale price thereof. Following the disclosure of such valuation, the Staff informed us of its determination that, as a result of such revised valuation, we were not in compliance with the Equity Rule. We have submitted a request for review of the Staff\u2019s decision by the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council (the \u201cCouncil\u201d). We have also commenced the process of seeking to trade our shares of common stock on the OTC Markets. Currently, we are trading on the OTC Pink Sheets. . However, we can provide no assurance that the review by the Council will result in the continued listing of our shares of common stock or that the shares of common stock will be admitted for trading on the OTC Markets. The OTC Markets also are a less liquid market than Nasdaq, which may have a material adverse effect on the trading price and volume for the common stock. We are also considering listing alternatives, including applying to list our shares of common stock on another securities exchange. The delisting of our securities by Nasdaq could adversely affect the trading market for our securities, as price quotations may not be as readily obtainable, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities and the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that trading in our securities will continue over the counter or otherwise. As a result of the delisting, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: \u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; \u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; 45 \u25cf a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock; \u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and \u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing, including pursuant to the Fifth Securities Purchase Agreement, the July 2025 Keystone Purchase Agreement, or otherwise, in the future. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because they have been delisted, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. This state level regulation introduces additional compliance requirements for brokers to consider making markets in our securities and will further negatively impact any trading liquidity in our securities. We may pursue orphan drug designation for certain of our product candidates, and we may not be able to obtain such designation, or obtain or maintain the benefits of such designation including orphan drug exclusivity, and even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent regulatory authorities from approving other competing products. In June 2025, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to CER-1236 for the treatment of AML. We may seek orphan designation for additional product candidates in the future; however, we may never receive such designations. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the U.S. where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. A similar regulatory scheme governs orphan products in the EU. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and application fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. In addition, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same product for the same therapeutic indication for seven years. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products can be approved for the same condition. In addition, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same product for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of the patients with the rare disease or condition. Additionally, the FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted. The issuance of shares of our Common Stock upon conversion or exercise of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Common Warrants and other securities that we may issue in future financing transactions may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. On October 31, 2025, the Common Stock ceased trading on Nasdaq as a result of the Panel\u2019s delisting determination and has commenced trading on the OTC Pink Sheets. Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations for each of Series A Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock, the suspension from trading or failure of the Company\u2019s Common Stock to be trading or listed on either The New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE American, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market, or the Nasdaq Capital Market constitutes a Triggering Event (as defined in the applicable Certificate of Designations) with regards setting the conversion price for each of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock. As of November 19, 2025, the Company currently has outstanding (i) 1,429 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a conversion value of approximately $1.4 million, convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of the stated value thereof divided by a current effective conversion price of $0.05; (ii) 7 shares of Series C Preferred Stock with a stated value of approximately $7,000, convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of the stated value thereof divided by a conversion price of $0.05 (iii) Series A Warrants to purchase 306 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $2,780.00 per share; (iv) Series C Warrants to purchase 4,088 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.80; (v) December 2024 and January 2025 Common Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12,396 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price ranging from $112.20 to $116.40, (vi) February 2025 Common Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 127,551 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $39.20, (vii) Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,787 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.002, (ix) Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,596 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $23,000.00 per share, (x) 5,352 shares of Series D Preferred Stock with a conversion value of approximately $5.4 million, convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of the stated value thereof divided by a current effective conversion price of $0.05, and (xi) 3,816 shares of Series E Preferred Stock with a conversion value of approximately $3.8 million, convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of the stated value thereof divided by a current effective conversion price of $4.1625. 46 Although each of the conversion price of most of the Preferred Shares and the exercise prices of the December 2024 Common Warrants, January 2025 Common Warrants, Series A Warrants and February 2025 Common Warrants are at or above the trading price of our Common Stock as of the date of this Quarterly Report, if such trading price increases, such conversion prices and exercise prices will not change as a result thereof and could be below the trading price of our Common Stock as of the date of any future conversion or exercise thereof, resulting in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock contain certain penalties and adjustments to the amount included in determination of the conversion rate following certain breaches of the Company\u2019s obligations thereunder, including, among other things, as a result of a failure to file or cause the SEC to declare one or more registration statements relating to the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof by specified deadlines, certain defaults under indebtedness of the Company or judgments against the Company and failure to deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion in a timely manner. For example, the penalties and adjustments include a 25% premium added to the stated value for determining the conversion rate in connection with breaches other than the breach of the requirement to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock by August 19, 2025, which results in a 50% premium, and the addition to the stated value of an amount equal to the value of the shares of Common Stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock would have been convertible if the conversion price were equal to 80% of the lowest volume weighted average price during the five trading days immediately prior to conversion. Such penalties and adjustments, which applied during the period when substantially all of the conversions since the Business Combination occurred as a result of a failure to file and cause the SEC to declare a registration statement with respect to the resale of the underlying shares in a timely manner, have resulted and may in the future result in the issuance of shares of Common Stock at an effective conversion price below the trading price of our Common Stock at the time of such conversion. We cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance with all of the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock and that such penalties and adjustments will not apply in the future. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not issue additional convertible or other derivative securities with highly dilutive penalty or adjustment provisions. As described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, the Company needs to obtain financing to fund its research and development activities and clinical trials, as well as other operations. Under challenging conditions in the equity capital markets, particularly for pre-commercialization biotech companies, we may have no viable alternatives to agreeing to inclusion of such provisions in the terms of future financings. Disruptions at the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies caused by reduction in staffing, funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business. The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including staffing levels, government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund R&D activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. The Trump Administration has issued executive orders seeking to greatly reduce the size of the federal workforce, including through layoffs and severance packages offered to employees of federal agencies within the executive branch and independent agencies, including the SEC and the FDA. Any such reduction in personnel may result in longer review times by the FDA or SEC. Disruptions and personnel turnover, as a result of leadership changes, staff reductions or otherwise, at the FDA and other government agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. In addition to the potential reduction in staffing, a government shutdown could adversely affect the FDA review process. Over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations. Similar consequences would also result if the shutdown of the federal government continues for an extended period. Currently, federal agencies in the U.S. are operating under a federal government shutdown due to the expiration of the continuing resolution that expired on September 30, 2025. The duration of the current government shutdown is unknown. In addition, the Trump administration has issued executive orders and taken other measures seeking to greatly reduce the size of the federal workforce, including through layoffs and severance packages offered to employees of federal agencies within the executive branch and independent agencies, including the FDA. Any such reduction in personnel may result in longer review times by the FDA, the SEC and other agencies. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if geopolitical or global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns or substantial leadership, personnel, and policy changes could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations. 47 The impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, and may adversely affect our business model. Our revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For more information, see the section of titled \u201c Business \u2013 Healthcare Laws and Regulations \u2013 Healthcare Reform \u201d in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. For example, the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, administered by CMS as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, commonly referred to as the IRA, may apply to our products if they are selected for negotiation, which could materially reduce the amount of revenue we can generate from our products if they are approved. Prior to the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (\u201cOBBBA\u201d), orphan drugs were exempt from Medicare price negotiation under the IRA only if they had received a single orphan designation and were approved solely for the corresponding rare disease or condition. The OBBBA amended this exemption to apply more broadly: now, any orphan-designated drug is exempt from price negotiation, regardless of the number of orphan designations it has received, provided the drug\u2019s approved indications are exclusively for those rare diseases. The OBBBA also included significant reforms to Medicaid, including an estimated $1 trillion in reduced federal Medicaid spending from 2025 through 2034, the imposition of work requirements for certain adult enrollees, more frequent eligibility redeterminations, and increased cost-sharing for beneficiaries. These changes are expected to reduce overall Medicaid enrollment and access to care. Although the effect on our future product candidates or business is unknown, any decrease in the number of insured patients or reimbursement levels for our products could adversely affect our potential for revenue and our commercial prospects. In addition, multiple executive actions in the first half of 2025 signal the federal government\u2019s increasing focus on lowering prescription drug prices, adding to the uncertainty surrounding future drug pricing and reimbursement frameworks. For example: \u25cf On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed the executive order titled \u201cDelivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing,\u201d which directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) to identify and communicate most-favored-nation price targets for prescription drugs and to propose a rulemaking plan to impose such pricing if \u201csignificant progress\u201d is not made. The order also directs the federal government to explore regulatory pathways that would facilitate direct-to-patient sales for manufacturers that meet these price targets. Additionally, it signals potential further action against manufacturers that fail to offer most-favored-nation pricing, including evaluating whether to modify or rescind marketing approvals or allow individual drug importation waivers. In July 2025, President Trump sent letters to pharmaceutical companies demanding further reduced prices more in line with most-favored-nation pricing. On September 30, 2025, the White House announced the first MFN agreement (Pfizer), and reports indicate additional negotiations are ongoing. The scope, timing, and ultimate impact of any further actions or agreements remain uncertain. Further, in September and October 2025, multiple drug manufacturers announced plans to, for certain of their drugs, lower prices to reflect similar pricing around the world, and to sell these reduced-price drugs on a direct-to-consumer purchasing platform that is yet to be developed by the federal government. \u25cf Previously, on April 15, 2025, President Trump issued the executive order \u201cLowering Drug Prices by Once Again Putting Americans First,\u201d which contains a broad set of directives aimed at reducing drug costs. Among other actions, the order directs HHS to revise guidance under the Inflation Reduction Act (\u201cIRA\u201d) to eliminate the so-called \u201cpill penalty,\u201d which currently subjects small molecule drugs to Medicare price negotiation four years earlier than biologics. The order also calls for a comprehensive evaluation of the role played by pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d) in drug pricing and market access. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect: \u25cf the demand for our product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval; \u25cf our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products; \u25cf our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product; \u25cf our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; \u25cf the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and \u25cf the availability of capital. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability. 48 We face risks associated with tariffs and other trade restrictions, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We face risks related to tariffs and other trade protection measures\u2014including those that have been or may be imposed by the United States or other countries\u2014as well as import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes, sanctions (including those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control), and other trade barriers (including further legislation or actions taken by the United States or other countries that restrict trade). These risks include protectionist or retaliatory measures that may limit or complicate the sourcing of raw materials, equipment, and other components critical to our research and development activities. The United States has imposed significant tariffs on a range of imported goods, including a baseline tariff of 10% and higher rates targeting specific countries. In response, several countries have enacted retaliatory measures, and the situation remains unpredictable. While pharmaceutical end-products are currently excluded from certain tariffs, current or future tariffs will result in increased research and development expenses, including with respect to increased costs associated with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), raw materials, laboratory equipment and research materials and components. In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce is conducting a Section 232 investigation to assess the national security implications of pharmaceutical and API imports. The outcome of this investigation could result in additional trade restrictions, including tariffs, consistent with ongoing efforts to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing. Further, the United States and the European Union have announced the framework of a trade agreement that could impose a 15% tariff on most imports from the EU, including pharmaceutical products and inputs. However, the details of this trade agreement remain uncertain, including whether and to what extent such agreement may be impacted by the results of the Section 232 investigation. We may face increased costs and operational disruptions if existing or future tariffs are applied to materials or components used in the development and manufacture of our product candidates. These risks also extend to indirect effects, such as retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries or additional non-tariff trade barriers. As a result, our research and development activities, manufacturing timelines, and overall financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the OBBBA was signed into law on July 4, 2025 and made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law. Under Section 174 of the Code, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, expenses that are incurred for research and development performed outside the U.S. will be capitalized and amortized, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow. The OBBBA provides that for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, expenses that are incurred for research and development performed in the United States may, at the taxpayer\u2019s election, be immediately deducted or capitalized and amortized. In addition, the OBBBA provides that for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025, certain eligible taxpayers generally may elect to retroactively deduct expenses for research and development performed in the U.S. in such taxable years by filing amended tax returns for such taxable years, and all other taxpayers that are not eligible to make such an election and that amortized expenses for research and development performed in the U.S. in such taxable years generally may elect to accelerate and deduct the remaining unamortized amounts of such research and development expenses (i) in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024, or (ii) ratably over the two-taxable year period beginning with the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to federal tax laws. Future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. We have identified a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of such material weaknesses is not effective, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired. We are required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In 2026, five years after our Initial Public Offering, we may be required to comply with auditor attestation requirements, as required by Section 404. This will require that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts. 49 In preparing each of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and related comparison periods, we identified material weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures, as defined in the SEC guidelines for public companies. The material weaknesses identified relate to our conclusion that due to a lack of sufficient and qualified resources, we lack effective processes and controls to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, including processes for assessing and accounting for the impact of preferred stock conversions and deficiencies in the recognition and valuation of investments in equity securities. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weakness identified in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements, we were unable to file this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in a timely manner. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weakness. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Our control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. If we do not file financial statements on a timely basis as required by the SEC, we could face severe consequences. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Moreover, responding to such investigations are likely to consume a significant amount of our management resources and cause us to incur significant legal and accounting expenses. Failure to remedy any material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, or to maintain effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. As a public reporting company, we are subject to filing deadlines for reports that we file pursuant to the Exchange Act, and our failure to timely file such reports may have material adverse consequences on our business. Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we failed to timely file our Form 8-K with Form 10 information prior to the \u201cstaleness\u201d date (as determined in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) applicable to the financial statements that were required by the applicable accounting requirements and other rules and regulations of the SEC to be included in such filing (including pro forma financial information); thus, we have not remained timely in our reporting requirements with the SEC since we became an SEC reporting company on February 14, 2024. Although we regained status as a current filer by filing a Form 8-K/A with current financial statements on April 1, 2024, we were unable to remain timely in our reporting requirements as a result of our failure to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2025 by August 19, 2025, the extended deadline resulting from our filing of a notice on Form 12b-25 on August 15, 2025, as a result, we will not be eligible to file any new registration statement on Form S-3 and, following any requirement to amend any existing registration statement on Form S-3, including as a result of the updating of such registration statement pursuant to Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act upon the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, we will not be eligible to use any existing registration statement on Form S-3, in each case, that would allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement, or to use \u201cshelf\u201d registration statements to conduct offerings, until approximately one year from the date we regained (and maintain) status as a current and timely filer. Until such time, if we determine to pursue an offering, we would be required to conduct the offering on an exempt basis, such as in accordance with Rule 144A, or file a registration statement on Form S-1. Using a Form S-1 registration statement for a public offering would likely take significantly longer than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, and could, to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods, adversely impact our liquidity, ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions in a timely manner. The use of Form S-1 would also prevent us from conducting offerings on a \u201cshelf basis,\u201d limiting our flexibility as to the terms, timing or manner of any such offering. 50 We cannot guarantee that in the future our reporting will always be timely. If we are unable to satisfy SEC filing deadlines or otherwise provide disclosures of material information on a timely basis, stockholders and potential investors in our Common Stock may have incomplete information about our business and results of operations, which may impact their ability to make an informed investment decision, result in a reduction in the trading price, trading volume or analyst coverage of our Common Stock or expose us to potential liability.",

        "risk_factors": "Risks Related to Evaluation of Strategic Options and Bankruptcy Proceedings Our exploration and pursuit of strategic options and additional financing may not be successful. As described above, Oxford Finance swept substantially all of our cash resources from our bank accounts. Subject to consummation of an additional financing transaction with the Individual Lender or another third-party, we plan to continue to comply with its filing obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and resume our exploration of strategic options, which may include a sale, license, merger or other monetization of remaining assets, the seeking of additional financing or, subject to the availability of additional funding, the resumption 50 Table of Contents of certain research and development activities. Any future resumption of our historical research and development activities would depend on completing a strategic transaction that would support our prior operating plans or otherwise obtaining significant additional funding. We have engaged a financial advisor to advise on the exploration of strategic options. There can be no assurance that such exploration of strategic options will result in us pursuing a transaction or obtaining additional financing or that any such transaction or financing will be completed, nor as to the terms on which any such transaction or financing will occur, if at all. If we do not enter into any such transaction or financing prior to the utilization of the proceeds of the Convertible Loan Agreement, we expect that Oxford Finance will resume its efforts to foreclose on our assets. Our exploration of strategic options may not result in the realization of any value for our company or our stockholders. Even if we do consummate a strategic option, the value of our common stock and/or the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, if any, will depend heavily on the proceeds derived from the strategic option, the timing of any distribution to stockholders, as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities. Our board of directors may elect to commence bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Our board of directors may decide that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to commence bankruptcy proceedings. It may be necessary for us to pursue bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the United States Bankruptcy Code. It is unlikely that there will cash available for distribution to stockholders in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding. Accordingly, holders of our common stock and other securities could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the company. We are substantially dependent on our remaining employees and consultants, along with any other advisors and consultants we may engage, to facilitate pursuit of strategic options and additional financing. Our ability to successfully identify and consummate any strategic options and obtain additional financing, if any, depends in large part on our ability to retain our remaining employees and consultants along with any other advisors and consultants we may engage. One or more may terminate their engagement with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could potentially harm our ability to identify, evaluate and pursue strategic options and pursue potential additional financing. We may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages. In the past, securities class action litigation has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, or the announcement of negative events, such as clinical trial results. These events may also result in investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may be exposed to such litigation or investigation even if no wrongdoing occurred. Litigation and investigations are usually expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect any of our remaining cash resources and our ability to consummate a potential strategic option or identify additional funding. If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We must satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share and either a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2,500,000, or a minimum market value of our common stock of at least $35,000,000, or risk delisting, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. There are many factors that may adversely affect our ability comply with the requirements for continued listing. Many of these factors are outside of our control. On November 10, 2025, we received another deficiency letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), or the Minimum MVLS Capital Requirement, for continued listing on 51 Table of Contents The Nasdaq Capital Market, as the market value of our listed securities was less than $35,000,000 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. Nasdaq also noted that we do not meet the alternative standards for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as we do not have a stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million or net income from continued operations of at least $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or for two of the three most recently completed fiscal years. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), we have been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until May 11, 2026, or the Compliance Date, to regain compliance with the Minimum MVLS Capital Requirement. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the market value of our listed securities closes at $35,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification to us that it has regained compliance with the Minimum MVLS Capital Requirement. If we do not regain compliance with the Minimum MVLS Requirement by the Compliance Date, Nasdaq will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal Nasdaq\u2019s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, or the Panel. However, there can be no assurance that, if we receive a delisting notice and appeal the delisting determination to the Panel, such appeal would be successful. We may also fail to satisfy other Nasdaq listing requirements, which could result in Nasdaq initiating a process to delist our common stock. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to pursue a strategic option and raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any potential delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq would also make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market. Moreover, any delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market or a transfer of the listing of our common stock to another nationally recognized stock exchange having listing standards that are less restrictive than The Nasdaq Capital Market, in each case after a specified cure period, are additional events of default under our Loan Agreement. We intend to monitor the market value of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum MVLS Capital Requirement. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements or that we will maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq Capital Markets listing requirements .",

        "risk_factors": "Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 30, 2025 and the proxy statement/prospectus. Our securities have been suspended from trading on Nasdaq since October 1, 2025, following an oral notification from Nasdaq. If this suspension were to result in our delisting from Nasdaq, it would have a material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of our securities held by our investors. As disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 6, 2025, following its listing on Nasdaq on October 1, 2025, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that it had received a notification from personnel at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the \u201cCSRC\u201d) informing Nasdaq that the CSRC had not yet completed its process of review of the Company\u2019s U.S. listing. As a result, Nasdaq has halted trading in the Company\u2019s Common Stock and Warrants while it seeks clarification of these matters from the Company (the \u201cTrading Halt\u201d). The Company believes it has satisfied its obligations with respect to the CSRC and has received a legal opinion from its Chinese securities counsel to that effect. The Company has provided Nasdaq with additional documentation. However, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Trading Halt is still in effect. If such Trading Halt were to continue, or if our securities were eventually delisted by Nasdaq our investors may face significant material adverse consequences due to their holding of our securities, including: \u25cf limited availability of market quotations for our securities; \u25cf significantly reduced or no liquidity for our securities; \u25cf a determination that our common stock is \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; \u25cf no longer being \u201ccovered securities,\u201d as further described below; \u25cf limited news and analyst coverage; and \u25cf decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the state of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. If Nasdaq eventually decides to delist our securities, we may face shareholder lawsuits, which would have a material adverse effect on our operation. If Nasdaq eventually proceeds to delist our securities, such delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our securities and would impair shareholders\u2019 ability to trade in our securities. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements. 28 Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from Nasdaq, for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. If our securities become illiquid, shareholders may be unable to trade their securities unless a market can be established or sustained, and similarly if investors are precluded from trading their securities, it could have dire consequences on our ability to raise more capital. If any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our business, profitability and reputation.",

        "risk_factors": "We are subject to certain risks as a result of QLE\u2019s investment in Skyline. As disclosed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, effective August 29, 2025, QLE completed an acquisition of the controlling interest in Skyline Builders Group Holding Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (\"Skyline\") with its Class A Ordinary Shares listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol \"SKBL\". QLE entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to purchase all 1,995,000 of Skyline's Class B Ordinary Shares, which carry super-voting rights, for the aggregate purchase price of $1,000,000 (\"Skyline Class B Purchase Agreement\"). Additionally, QLE entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to purchase (i) 454,794 Class A Ordinary Shares, (ii) a Prefunded Warrant to purchase 1,600,000 Class A Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share, (iii) a Class A Ordinary Share Purchase Warrant A to purchase up to 2,054,794 Class A Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $0.60 per share, and (iv) a Class A Ordinary Share Purchase Warrant B to purchase 2,054,794 Class A Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $0.65 per share, for the aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000 (\"Skyline Class A Purchase Agreement\"). After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Skyline Class B Purchase Agreement and the Skyline Class A Purchase Agreement and other related transactions involving Skyline and its former controlling shareholder, QLE became the holder of 79.14% of the aggregate voting power represented by all outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares, and thereby gaining control over Skyline. As a result, we consolidate the financial statements of Skyline, as well as our other subsidiaries, in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, we are subject both to the risks and benefits associated with the equity securities of Skyline and the risks and benefits associated with the underlying business of Skyline. Our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses and technologies with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing offerings. For example, effective October 21, 2025, QLE acquired substantially all assets of One 30 Seven (a Canadian company specializing in decontamination solutions for radioactive waste from nuclear power plants, radiopharmaceuticals, and military sources) in an acquisition intended to advance the development of Creber Micro, Mini, Midi, and Maxi Units and allow QLE to offer Nuclear Waste processing solutions. In addition, effective August 29, 2025, QLE completed an acquisition of the controlling interest in Skyline, which we intend to use to pursue opportunities to acquire assets in the critical materials supply chain that we believe will help the United States and QLE secure important feedstocks that are vital to the security of the United States and long-term growth of QLE. However, we cannot assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful or that we will identify or successfully complete suitable acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions that do not achieve the intended strategic or operational benefits could adversely affect our operating results and may result in an impairment charge. Under certain circumstances, it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations. Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including: (i) diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from daily operations; (ii) difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business; (iii) inability to obtain required regulatory approvals; (iv) inability to obtain required financing on favorable terms or, if so obtained, risks associated with 47 incurrence of substantial amounts of indebtedness to finance the acquisition; (iv) potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships, or key customers of acquired companies or from our existing businesses; and (v) assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies (including environmental, employee benefits, safety and health and third party property and casualty liabilities). Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or consolidated financial condition, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges. We may acquire companies or make investments or otherwise enter into new markets in which we have little or no experience, which may lead us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such entry and which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time we may acquire or make investments in companies or businesses to gain access to, or otherwise seek to enter, new product or geographic markets in which we have no, or only limited, familiarity and experience. In addition, we may acquire companies that have substantial operations in other lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience, that may be difficult to divest on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or for which we may incur significant costs to divest. For example, with the acquisition of the controlling interest in Skyline, which we intend to use to pursue opportunities to acquire assets in the critical materials supply chain, we acquired ongoing civil engineering services operations Hong Kong, which is not the focus of our other business and operations. We may fail to achieve the business objectives that we intended to achieve at the time we acquired or invested in a company or entered into a new market, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.",

        "risk_factors": "As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, as of the date of this Report, except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s (i) most recent prospectus for the initial public offering as filed with the February 14, 2022, (ii) its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 and September 16, 2024, and (iii) its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022, August 15, 2022, November 14, 2022, May 15, 2023 and August 14, 2023, respectively. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial business combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Military or other conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East or elsewhere may lead to increased volume and price volatility for publicly traded securities, or affect the operations or financial condition of potential target companies, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate the Business Combination. Military or other conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East or elsewhere may lead to increased volume and price volatility for publicly traded securities, or affect the operations or financial condition of potential target companies, and to other company or industry-specific, national, regional or international economic disruptions and economic uncertainty, any of which could make it more difficult for us to consummate the Business Combination. A 1% U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption (a \u201cRedemption Event\u201d). Pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, commencing in 2023, a 1% U.S. federal excise tax (the \u201cExcise Tax\u201d) is imposed on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation and not on its stockholders. The amount of the Excise Tax is equal to 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury Department\u201d) has authority to promulgate regulations and provide other guidance regarding the Excise Tax. In December 2022, the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention to propose such regulations and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Accordingly, redemptions of our public shares in connection with an extension of the Combination Period may subject us to the Excise Tax, unless one of the two exceptions above apply. Such redemptions would only occur if an extension of the Combination Period is approved by our stockholders and such extension is implemented by the board of directors. 33 Table of Contents If the deadline for us to complete a business combination (currently February 15, 2024) is extended, our public stockholders will have the right to require us to redeem their public shares. Any redemption or other repurchase may be subject to the Excise Tax. The extent to which we would be subject to the Excise Tax in connection with a Redemption Event would depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Redemption Event, (ii) the nature and amount of any \u201cPIPE\u201d or other equity issuances in connection with the business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the Redemption Event but issued within the same taxable year of the business combination), (iii) if we fail to timely consummate a business combination and liquidate in a taxable year subsequent to the year in which a Redemption Event occurs and (iv) the content of any proposed or final regulations and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the Excise Tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holders, the mechanics of any required payment of the Excise Tax remain to be determined. Any Excise Tax payable by us in connection with a Redemption Event may cause a reduction in the cash available to us to complete a business combination and could affect our ability to complete a business combination.",

        "risk_factors": "As highlighted earlier, on February 28, the Company amended its investment strategy. As a result, the Company is adding the following risk factors below. This not meant to be a comprehensive list of all risk factors. The US Government May Cease to Offer Loan Guarantees Programs. A core investment strategy of the Company is offering bridge loans for businesses that have been approved for a government guaranteed loan by an approved lender but are waiting on formal government loan approval. If the US Government cancels these programs, this investment strategy may not be viable. The US Government May Not Honor Its Loan Guarantee US Government runs multiple loan guarantees programs to encourage economic development. If the US Government decided to not honor its loan guarantees, it could have a significant impact on the Company, including, but not limited to, ending the bridge investment strategy, ending the warehousing strategy, and the Company may find itself holding loans whose value has been significantly impaired. Government Efficiency Eliminates the Need for Bridge Loans The Company\u2019s bridge strategy is predicated on the significant delay between when the approved lender authorizes the US Government-backed loan and when the US Government entity formally approves its guarantee. If the US Government dramatically speeds up the process, there may be no need for the Company to offer bridge financing. The Government Agency Refuses to Approve a Loan which the Company has Provided Bridge Financing The Company provides bridge financing where a business loan has been approved by a lender but is waiting on formal sign-off from the US Government. If the US Government entity decides to not approve the loan, then Company may not be able to exit its bridge loan or only able to exit at a loss. Warehoused Loans May Not Sell The Company warehouses government-guaranteed portion of loans for resale. Typically, these are held for three months or less, and, historically, these loans typically sell at a premium to par because of the government guarantee. However, if the Company cannot sell these loans profitably, it may take a loss to exit, or it may be stuck holding the loans for the foreseeable future. The Company intends to require loan originators to buy back loans that will not sell. However, not every agreement may have this put requirement, and the originator may refuse to honor this obligation. Resale of the US Government-Guaranteed Portion of Loans is Impacted by Multiple Factors Factors that impact pricing of US Government-guaranteed portion of loans include, but are not limited to, loan term, interest rate (including formula if floating), industry, size of the loan, prepayment terms, underlying quality of the company, and servicing fees. All these factors impact pricing. US Government Regulations May Restrict Bridge Loans and Warehousing Loans The Company is currently not a licensed lender for any Government program. This could have implications for our business. We currently work with third party licensed lenders. 22 Government Shutdown Has Impacted the Company\u2019s Ability to Operate and to Comply with Regulations The Company currently holds participating interest in loans which are guaranteed by the US government. The Company cannot resell its interest during the government shutdown. The Company has made bridge loans to where it expects to be taken out by permanent financing guaranteed by the US government. This cannot happen while the US Government is shut down. Treatment of Participating Interest in Government-Guaranteed Loans In cases where the Company has acquired a participating interest in the US Government-guaranteed portion of a loan guaranteed by the US government; the Company is treating it as government security for portfolio diversification requirements for the IRS and SEC since the investment is 100% guaranteed by the federal government, and these investment price similar to US Government debt. If this treatment is reversed, the Company may not comply with portfolio diversification requirements, which has implications. Treatment of CBT SF LLC The Company has decided to treat CBT SF LLC as an investment company and consolidate it. This has implications for portfolio diversification and debt leverage requirements, as we include the investments in our assets, and equity, as we treat the participation capital invested in CBT SF LLC as equity. If this treatment is reversed, the Company may not comply with SEC & IRS requirements. 23",

        "risk_factors": "33 Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 27, 2025 and July 27, 2025, and below. Any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Long manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and capacity availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately, has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums, provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. If we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties. If we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. Factors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, include: \u2022 changes in product development cycles and time to market; \u2022 competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions; \u2022 changes in business and economic conditions; \u2022 sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues; \u2022 rapidly changing technology or customer requirements; \u2022 the availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure; \u2022 new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products; \u2022 new or unexpected end-use cases; \u2022 increase in demand for competitive products; \u2022 changes in end-user demand; \u2022 purchasing decisions made, and inventory levels held by, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, system integrators, other channel partners and other third parties; \u2022 the ability of developers, end customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms; \u2022 the demand for accelerated computing, AI-related cloud services, or large language models; 34 \u2022 changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies; \u2022 government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls, increased restrictions on gaming usage, or tariffs \u2022 our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 ability to secure capital and energy and to build complex datacenter infrastructure timely; and \u2022 the availability of third-party content on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance. Expanding energy capacity to meet demand is a complex, multi-year process involving significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges. In addition, access to capital can be particularly constrained for less-capitalized companies, which may face difficulties securing financing for large-scale infrastructure projects. These limitations could delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. Geopolitical tensions in regions where we rely on suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners that are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. Publicly announced intentions by governments or other companies to purchase our products can further complicate our demand estimates, as such announcements are often non-binding and may not result in committed volumes. We continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. We are increasing our U.S.-based manufacturing and investing in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. We may experience delays or difficulties in scaling production as planned. Our ability to increase manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume timely. Delays or shortfalls could impact our ability to meet demand. Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. Customers may delay adopting new architectures if their data center infrastructure is not ready, which could affect the timing of our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. 35 Demand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of accelerated computing and AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. The use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future, demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Our inability to accurately predict our demand that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our revenue. We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions or investments, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions is harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Our investments in publicly traded and private companies could create volatility and fluctuations in our results. These investments may generate realized and unrealized gains or losses and we could realize losses up to the value of the investments. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the securities in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we may not be able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. We expect to continue investing in strategic partnerships. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, we entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI. In November 2025, we entered into an agreement, subject to certain closing conditions, to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic. There is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity or other potential investments, or that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all. The timing and magnitude of these and other investments we may make will depend on various factors, including the ability of our partners to successfully develop and deploy AI infrastructure. There can be no certainty as to the timing or amount of capital we may ultimately invest in these or other strategic partnerships, and we may be limited by our available liquidity and capital resources. We have committed to make an equity investment in Intel Corporation, subject to regulatory approval. This investment involves execution, financing, and operational risks, including dependence on the partner\u2019s ability to scale production and deliver competitive technology on schedule. We may not realize the anticipated strategic benefits. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management\u2019s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an 36 acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring. Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to: \u2022 difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business; \u2022 assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets; \u2022 integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; \u2022 coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate; \u2022 stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition; \u2022 potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions; \u2022 the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities; \u2022 the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration; \u2022 negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate; \u2022 exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and \u2022 impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target\u2019s employees, vendors and customers. For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future. We may be required to satisfy financial obligations under guarantees and other commercial commitments. We have entered into, and may in the future enter into, commercial arrangements, including long-term capacity purchase obligations and financial guarantees supporting our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 buildout of datacenter infrastructure. These arrangements expose us to counterparty risk, including customers' or partners' inability to secure necessary financing or infrastructure, significant project delays, or financial distress or insolvency. Despite our efforts to mitigate these exposures, if triggered, these obligations could require payments that may negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which may adversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs, and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and CSP market as 37 part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome and could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners. Governments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already enacted regulations concerning AI technologies, with new state laws scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs. Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future. The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings. Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results. Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls and other restrictions targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are likely to be more restrictive, would further limit our ability to export our technology, products, or services, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China. 38 Export controls have and could in the future disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China and for our non-data center products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business. Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls has and could in the future lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. On September 15, 2025, China\u2019s antitrust regulators published their preliminary finding that our compliance with applicable U.S. export controls, which required us to offer degraded products to the Chinese market, discriminated unfairly against customers in the China market and therefore violated the terms of China\u2019s approval of our Mellanox acquisition. If regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill the terms of our Mellanox acquisition or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, restrictions or other orders regarding our networking business, products, and services, or otherwise impact our operations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China\u2019s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impacted exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D:1, D:4, and D:5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20\u2019s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished. The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the \u201cperformance density\u201d of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. Under the current rules and geopolitical landscape, we are unable to create and deliver a competitive product for China\u2019s data center market that receives approval from both the USG and the Chinese government. We have effectively been foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, and our effective foreclosure from the China market will help our competitors build larger developer and customer ecosystems to challenge us worldwide. Unless we are able to return with a product that meets the approval of both the USG and the Chinese government, our lost opportunity and the benefit to our competitors will have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition to controls targeting D:1, D:4 and D:5 countries, the USG has also imposed worldwide export controls impacting our products, and may impose additional controls in the future. On January 15, 2025, the USG published the AI Diffusion IFR in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. The AI Diffusion IFR would have divided the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to \u201cTier 2\u201d status, and would have created a complex and burdensome scheme for licensing approvals. 39 In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, in October 2025, the Senate passed the \u201cGAIN AI Act\u201d in the NDAA. The GAIN AI Act would restrict the Trump Administration\u2019s ability to adapt the Biden Administration\u2019s export control rules, and could also allow private U.S. persons to review and overturn licensing and foreign policy decisions made by the Trump Administration. Our competitive position has been harmed by export controls, and our competitive position and future results will be further harmed, over the long term, if the restrictions remain in place or are expanded in geographic, customer, or product scope, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. The licensing process may not be resolved before significant business opportunities evaporate. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses have already and may in the future be temporary, impose burdensome conditions regarding the installation, maintenance, and use of such products, or include financial or economic requirements that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements have already and may in the future benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China, the Middle East, and other regions to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have generated approximately $50 million in H20 revenue under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% or more of the revenue generated from licensed sales of our products, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. In the event that we are able to sell licensed products into the China market and the USG implements a regulation requiring us to pay a percentage of the revenue from such sales, we may not be able to pass along all or any of that fee to our customers, and may be subject to litigation, increased costs, and a harmed competitive position. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements. For example, the USG already imposed license conditions that limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, such as imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. Such government mandates in chip designs could introduce system vulnerabilities and expose us to significant risk and potential liability, negatively impact demand for our products, and could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Even if not enacted into binding legislation, draft bills have impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business. For example, following U.S. legislative proposals calling for mandatory features in our chips, China\u2019s government publicly questioned whether our H20 products have built-in vulnerabilities, discouraging customers from purchasing our products. We provided a public response explaining that our GPUs, including H20, do not include such built-in vulnerabilities, and will respond to any follow-up questions we receive. Open-source foundation models are rapidly growing in popularity with developers worldwide. Any regulatory control or other restriction that limits our ability to provide products and services that support third-party applications and models, including applications built on foundation models originating in China such as DeepSeek, Qwen, or KIMMI, could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The USG already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Export controls have and are likely in the future to have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Export controls have already 40 and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to \u201cdesign-out\u201d certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, export controls have in the past and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale, resulting in excess inventory and purchase obligations as we recently experienced with the H20. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. The increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek to strictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products, even when unsubstantiated and untrue, may negatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the \u201cspirit\u201d of the applicable regulations, as well as incorrect allegations that legitimate and appropriate business is using supposed \u201cloopholes\u201d in the export controls may negatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted \u201cConnected Vehicle\u201d restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also considering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China. Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business. Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and even if we are able to participate in the China data center compute market, increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government has encouraged customers to purchase from our China-based competitors and restricted customers from purchasing, importing, or using our data center products, including any China-specific product designed to comply with U.S. export controls. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. Although we are already effectively foreclosed from the China market by U.S. export controls, if those controls changed to allow us to return to the market, the Chinese government could modify or implement the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, which may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results. Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial results.",

        "risk_factors": "Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and the risk factors set forth in our 2024 Annual Report, together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d contained in our 2024 Annual Report. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report. The Company has not generated a significant amount of net income, and it may not be able to sustain profitability in the future. As reflected in the unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company had a loss from continuing operations of $1.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, net income attributable to common shareholders of $16.1 million and $15.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had cash of $0.3 million, marketable securities of $45.4 million, and working capital in its continuing operations of $46.7 million. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to generate income in the future or be profitable. We may need to raise additional capital to acquire companies in complementary and high-growth technology sectors and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our anticipated acquisition activities. For the foreseeable future we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from revenue generated from operations and equity and debt offerings and cash on hand. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our acquisitions, and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business and also have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. We currently do not have any commitment for funding. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that may be sold. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the funds needed, especially in light of the fact that our ability to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited until such time the market value of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is $75 million or more. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner . In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness relates to the design and execution of controls over the accounting and disclosure of significant and unusual transactions, including the related income tax implications. This weakness was identified in connection with the divestiture of a material portion of our business that occurred late in the quarter. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although we are actively implementing a remediation plan, including enhancing internal review procedures and engaging appropriate internal and external resources, the material weakness has not yet been fully remediated. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act. During the third quarter of 2025, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to the accounting for significant and unusual transactions. Specifically, the controls related to the analysis utilized in the financial reporting process and the related income tax implication of the significant and unusual transactions. Management plans to fully remediate the identified material weakness in internal controls, however, there can be no assurance that the internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. In addition, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. A shutdown of the U.S. federal government may adversely affect our business. A recurring shutdown of the U.S. federal government may adversely affect our business operations and regulatory compliance. During such shutdowns, while the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system remains operational, the unavailability of SEC staff to review filings, issue comments, or declare registration statements effective may delay our ability to complete public offerings, respond to comment letters, or obtain timely regulatory approvals. These delays could impact our access to capital markets, hinder strategic transactions, and create uncertainty around our disclosure obligations. Additionally, the lack of interpretive guidance or exemptive relief during a shutdown may increase legal and compliance risks. There can be no assurance that future shutdowns will not materially affect our operations or financial condition. 22 Our growth may be impacted by acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. Our future growth may depend in part on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. Our Board is actively evaluating multiple strategic alternatives for the use of the remaining sale proceeds, which as stated above, include targeted acquisitions in high growth sectors, a reverse merger or a hybrid of the foregoing. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, or integrate acquisitions successfully. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services, and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Upon exercise of the Company\u2019s outstanding options or warrants, the Company will be obligated to issue a substantial number of additional shares of Common Stock which will dilute its present shareholders. The Company is obligated to issue additional shares of its Common Stock in connection with any exercise or conversion, as applicable, of its outstanding options, warrants, and shares of its convertible preferred stock. The exercise of warrants or options will cause the Company to issue additional shares of its Common Stock and will dilute the percentage ownership of its shareholders. In addition, the Company has in the past, and may in the future, exchange outstanding securities for other securities on terms that are dilutive to the securities held by other shareholders not participating in such an exchange. The Company may be the target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into agreements similar to the Divestiture involving a sale of a line of business or other business combinations. In addition, the Company may be subject to private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by shareholders, customers, employees, competitors, government agencies, or others. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and divert significant amounts of management time and resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to the Company, or the Company were to enter into a settlement arrangement, it could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on its ability to operate its business, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, liquidity financial condition, and operating results. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company was not aware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the Divestiture. 23",

        "risk_factors": "Risk factors . We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. However, we have included the \\following risk factor which updates the risk factor set forth in the Annual Report. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to be permitted to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm within three years. This three-year period was shortened to two years upon the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. There are uncertainties under the PRC Securities Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies to conduct investigations and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations, they may suspend or de-register our registration with the SEC and delist our securities from applicable trading market within the US. \u201d The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) was signed into law on December 18, 2020, and requires Auditors of publicly traded companies to submit to regular inspections every three years to assess such auditors\u2019 compliance with applicable professional standards. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 amended the HFCAA and reduced the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or being delisted. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China and in Hong Kong because of positions taken by PRC and Hong Kong authorities in those jurisdictions. This report was vacated on December 15, 2022. Pursuant to each annual determination by the PCAOB, the SEC will, on an annual basis, identify issuers that have used non-inspected audit firms and thus are at risk of such suspensions in the future. Our auditor is based in Nigeria and is subject to PCAOB inspection. It is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, in the event the Nigerian authorities subsequently take a position disallowing the PCAOB to inspect our auditor, then we would need to change our auditor. Furthermore, due to the recent developments in connection with the implementation of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, we cannot assure you whether the SEC or other regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements. The requirement in the HFCAA, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, that the PCAOB be permitted to inspect the issuer\u2019s public accounting firm within two years, may result in the delisting of our securities from applicable trading markets in the U.S, in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our accounting firm at such future time. If the authorities in Nigeria subsequently take a position disallowing the PCAOB to inspect our auditor, the lack of inspection could cause trading in our securities to be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and as a result, our securities may be delisted from applicable trading markets within the US. 35 If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations, there exists a risk that they may determine to suspend or de-register our registration with the SEC and may also delist our securities from applicable trading market within the US. According to Article 177 of the Securities Law of the PRC (\u201cArticle 177\u201d), overseas securities regulatory authorities are prohibited from engaging in activities pertaining to investigations or evidence collection directly conducted within the territories of the PRC, and Chinese entities or individuals are further prohibited from providing documents and information in connection with securities business activities to any organizations and/or persons abroad without the prior consent of the securities regulatory authority of the State Council and the competent departments of the State Council. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any implementing rules or regulations which have been published regarding application of Article 177. We believe Article 177 is only applicable where the activities of overseas authorities constitute a direct investigation or evidence collection by such authorities within the territory of the PRC. Our principal business operation is conducted in Hong Kong. In the event that the U.S. securities regulatory agencies carry out an investigation on us such as an enforcement action by the Department of Justice, the SEC or other authorities, such agencies\u2019 activities will constitute conducting an investigation or collecting evidence directly within the territory of the PRC and accordingly fall within the scope of Article 177. In that case, the U.S. securities regulatory agencies may have to consider establishing cross-border cooperation with the securities regulatory authority of the PRC by way of judicial assistance, diplomatic channels or establishing a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authority of the PRC. However, there is no assurance that the U.S. securities regulatory agencies will succeed in establishing such cross-border cooperation in this particular case and/or establish such cooperation in a timely manner. Furthermore, as Article 177 is a recently promulgated provision, it remains unclear as to how it will be interpreted, implemented or applied by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission or other relevant government authorities. As such, there are uncertainties as to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies to conduct investigations and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) be permitted to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm within three years. This three year period will be shortened to two years if the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act is enacted. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations, there exists a risk that they may determine to suspend or de-register our registration with the SEC and may also delist our securities from applicable trading market within the US.",

        "risk_factors": "An extended U.S. Government shutdown could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A portion of our revenue is linked to projects supported directly or indirectly by U.S. government programs, including those administered by the Department of Energy (DOE). The U.S. continues to face a changing geopolitical environment, along with certain fiscal and economic challenges, and uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold. During periods of federal government shutdowns, many government agencies and contracting offices cease operations or operate at reduced capacity. These shutdowns may delay funding decisions, new contract awards, contract modifications, and may result in the suspension of ongoing work under existing contracts. In the event of a prolonged federal government shutdown, we may experience delays in critical DOE-dependent project milestones. This could include: \u2022 Postponed disbursement of grants or cooperative agreements; \u2022 Slower progression through loan guarantee processes; and \u2022 Financing bottlenecks for cost-share projects reliant on DOE commitments. Such delays could shift expected revenue recognition from project services, equipment sales, or offtake-linked products, particularly for projects in earlier cohorts where DOE involvement plays a catalytic role. Government shutdowns can also create uncertainty in federal budgeting and procurement priorities, which could reduce future opportunities for our products. We continue to actively manage this risk by seeking to diversify our project funding sources, engage private capital partners, and sequence project cohorts to mitigate dependency. Nonetheless, these efforts may not be successful, and prolonged government funding disruptions could negatively impact the timing of certain revenue streams and increase working capital pressure in the near term. The timing and duration of any shutdown are unpredictable, and we cannot estimate the ultimate effect on our business. Any prolonged or repeated shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and ability to execute our strategic objectives.",
